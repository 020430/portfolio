            <p>
              Hi and welcome to my portfolio ! I'm Keisha, a second year computer science student at Middlesex University,
              and I'm currently doing a study year abroad at Towson University.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've been using Codecademy to learn programming languages 
              such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.
              I'm currently learning SQL and hope to learn C/C++ next !
            </p>
            <p>
              Like mentioned previously I'm currently in American doing the second year of my degree and I'm really enjoying it! Moving from the UK to America was definetely difficult as it was the first time I travelled on my own but I'm glad I went for it. I really hope to gain some experience while I'm here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fun fact: I love cats !
            </p>
